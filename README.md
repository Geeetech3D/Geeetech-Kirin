Geeetech Kirin motherboard is a 3D printer motherboard launched by Geeetech that supports up to 8 channels up to 60V stepper motor. The main control adopts STM32H723ZGT6. It has a rich interface and up to 550Mhz main frequency, which can run Marlin, Klipper and other firmware. Is a 3D printing enthusiasts to meet the needs of a variety of DIY multi-function with the general motherboard. Compared with other similar motherboards on the market, Kirin V1.0 has made a lot of optimization in power filtering, short circuit protection, Raspberry PI power output, maintainability, etc., so as to ensure the stable and reliable work of Kirin motherboard.

Geeetech Kirin V1.0 has the following features compared to other motherboards of the same type:

﹡ The MCU adopts ARM Cortex M7 32-bit STM32H723ZGT6, the main frequency is up to 550MHz, and the flash memory capacity is up to 1MB.

﹡ Support Marlin2.0, Klipper, RRF firmware.

﹡ Motherboard support A4988, DRV8825, LV8729, ST820, TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2226, TMC5160A and other driver modules.

﹡ The motherboard supports sensorless limit configuration (sensorless).

﹡ 8 way motor drive, using pluggable module design.

﹡ The 8-way motor drive module can choose the voltage separately, you can choose 24V voltage input, you can also choose the maximum 60V voltage.

﹡ 8-way motor drive can use different models of drive modules at the same time.

﹡ Support 6 way limit switch, 2 way broken material detection plate.

﹡ Support 4 way hot end heating rod.

﹡ 1 CANBUS bus interface, using 6P6C RJ11 interface.

﹡ BL_Touch interface.

﹡ 1 onboard Micro SD card slot, which can be used for local printing of G-code, firmware upgrade.

﹡ Reserved RGB light strip interface.

﹡ Onboard 32KB EEPROM (ATMEL AT24C32).

﹡ Support LCD12864 screen.

﹡ Support serial screen, require the user to adapt.

﹡ Onboard USB Host interface, can be used to connect the U disk.

﹡ Reserve SPI interface, users can expand a variety of peripherals.

﹡ Reserved WIFI module interface, users can add their own.

﹡ Support 8 fans, of which 6 are PWM control fans, 2 are normally open fans, each fan supports 5V, 12V, 24V voltage selection.

﹡ On-board MX31865 chip, the default support 2/4-wire PT100/PT1000, users can also support 3-wire PT100/PT1000 by changing the resistance.

﹡ Online printing using the current popular Type-C interface, easy to use.

﹡ The output current of the 5V power chip can reach 8A, which can directly supply power to the Raspberry PI.

﹡ 5V power output voltage compensation, when the Raspberry PI full load will not produce low voltage alarm.

﹡ 5V power supply is designed with protection pin and protection diode to prevent short circuit between 5V and 12V or 24V during use, resulting in damage to the motherboard.

﹡ Drive module power filter capacitor adopts 100V high voltage capacitor, the use is more reliable and stable.

﹡ High power MOS tube is used in hot end and hot bed MOS tube, and heat dissipation is optimized, stable and reliable.

﹡ Onboard automotive level pluggable fuse, quick and convenient replacement.

﹡ After printing the shutdown interface, with the corresponding function module, the power of the 3D printer can be turned off after the model is printed, which is safe and power-saving.

﹡ Power off and continue to play interface, with the corresponding module, can be used after the main power off, the print head will be lifted from the model a certain height, to prevent the nozzle will burn the model.

﹡ Motherboard support USB-DFU function.
